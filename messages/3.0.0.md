# 3.0.0

## tldr

Although the number is screaming that this is something major it's nothing but a legacy API support drop release. 

## Features

Recently, OpenAI anounced that all non-chat APIs will be deprecated and slated to become obsolete at 04.01.2024[^1]. The functionalities previously provided by these APIs are now being integrated into the chat model API. So here we are.

## Hint

Please note that this plugin already supports all of those modes [insert, edit, replace] for modifing the text with chat model, just as it did with a specific API previously.


## HELP WANTED!!1

I'm stuck with implementing tests for this plugin, which is a crucial step to enhancing this plugin further. I would be happy if someone more proficient with this bit of ST plugin development reached out to me on gh[^2] and share some help with it. Here's the branch that I'm working on[^3].
