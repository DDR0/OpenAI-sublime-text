## ChatGPT mode

Comprehensive ChatGPT API support with a bunch of new commands.

### Summary

ChatGPT mode works the following way:
1. Run the `OpenAI: New Message` command
2. Wait until OpenAI performs a response (be VERY patient in the case of the GPT-4 model it's way slower than you could imagine).
3. On the Response plugin opens the `OpenAI completion` output panel with the whole log of your chat at [any] active Window.
4. If you would like to feth chat history to another window manually, you can do that by running the `OpenAI: Refresh Chat` command.
5. When you're done or want to start all over you should run the `OpenAI: Reset Chat History` command, which deletes the chat cache.

> You can bind both of the most usable commands `OpenAI: New Message` and `OpenAI: Show output panel`, to do that please follow `Settings`->`Package Control`->`OpenAI completion`->`Key Bindings`.

> As for now there's just a single history instance. I guess this limitation would disappear sometime, but highly likely it wouldn't be soon.

## [Multi]Markdown syntax with syntax highlight support (ChatGPT mode only).

ChatGPT output panel supports markdown syntax highlight. It should just work (if it's not please report an issue).

Although it's highly recommended to install the [`MultimarkdownEditing`](https://sublimetext-markdown.github.io/MarkdownEditing/) to apply syntax highlighting for code snippets provided by ChatGPT. `OpenAI completion` should just pick it up implicitly for the output panel content.

## Proxy support

That's it. Now you can set up a proxy for this plugin.
You can setup it up by overriding the proxy property in the `OpenAI completion` settings like follow:

```json
// Proxy setting
"proxy": {
    // Proxy address
    "address": "127.0.0.1",

    // Proxy port
    "port": 9898
}
```

## Disclaimer

Unfortunately, this version hasn't got covered with comprehensive testing, so there could be bugs. Please report them, so I'd be happy to release a patch.
