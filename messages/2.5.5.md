## 1 year Anniversary

There's not much in this update, except the celebration of the plugin itself 1 year release anniversary.

Just a few numbers out there:

1. 2,200+ install within this timeframe (~15 times less than VSC competitor has).
2. 55* on [gh](https://github.com/yaroslavyaroslav/OpenAI-sublime-text) (please consider to star it as well if you haven't done it already, this thing is matters for me).
3. 1 paid sponsorship in gh that helps to cover my OpenAI bills.

Impressive for a one week to start pet project, I'd say. So thank y'all for that.

A few words about what's next.

- GPT functions feature support within 2k24, I think this thing could have a great fit with ST JSON commands approach.
- Files upload API support within H1_2k24, some easy way to load the whole files to provide more context for a model.
- Wide range of other ChatGPT services support, not sure about that though, because of (1) haven't met any more as robust AI service as GPT4 yet, (2) this would open Pandora box in terms of whether a specific feature of the plugin works with a specific AI service, which I'd prefer to avoid.

As always y'all always welcome to raise an issue in gh about whatever.
