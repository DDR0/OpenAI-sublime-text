### Completion streaming support.

Yep, you've heard it right. That new cool shiny way that you see in the original OpenAI Chat now comes to Sublime. Embrace, behold and all that stuff. Jokes aside — this thing only makes GPT-4 completion workable, by releasing the most significant tradeoff it has — long answering time. I mean GPT-4 answering time is still the same, but now you starting to see it up to 20 seconds earlier which is matters in terms of UX.

### Drop the 2 farthest replies from the plugin cache dialogue.

Now if you reach the context window limit, you're getting asked whether you or not wish to delete the 2 farthest messages (1 yours and 1 from the assistant) to shorter the chat history. If yes, the plugin would drop them and resend all the other chat history to OpenAI servers once again. This thing is recursive and will spit the popup in your face until the chat history would fit within a given model context window again. On cancel it will do nothing, as expected.
